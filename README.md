# FAVR Ontology
This is an attempt to build an ontology out of [FAVR](https://www.ludov.ca/index.php/en/observation/graphical-technologies/game-favr), the framework for the analysis of visual representation in video games. This repository also holds the exported [Tropy](https://www.tropy.org/) templates that implemented the ontology.
